Definitions

  "This License" refers to version 1 of the ipi license.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds
    of works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
    License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
    "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
    in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of
    an exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of
    the earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
    on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
    permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
    infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on
    a computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
    distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
    public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
    parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user
    through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy,
    is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
    to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
    feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
    tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
    extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
    work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
    the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
    menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  version must link to the original repo and provide credit.
